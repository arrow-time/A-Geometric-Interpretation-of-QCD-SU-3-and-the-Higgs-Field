From Geometric Dynamics to Unified Fields: A Derivation Based on a Globally Topologically Invariant Two-Layer Fiber Bundle Chiral Space
This article primarily proceeds from a historical review of gravitational theory development to introduce the derivation process of the globally topologically invariant two-layer chiral fiber bundle space I have proposed.

1. Following Einstein's formulation of General Relativity (GR), gravitational theory entered the geometric era, with this geometric framework of gravity becoming the mainstream in academia. In the 1960s, Wheeler proposed the concept of "mass without mass," suggesting that mass itself is geometry. This provides an intuitive image where mass is a condensation of space, inducing a geometric stretching of the surrounding space. This compelling and attractive image offers a specific mechanism for how mass generates gravity.

2. Subsequently, the scientific community engaged in extensive and multifaceted discussions on unifying quantum field theories, yielding numerous outcomes. The primary path involves attempts to combine the geometry of GR with the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) to construct a space possessing both geometric and quantized configurations. Since the mid-20th century, theories such as soliton theory, quantized elastic analog models, loop quantum gravity, analog gravity, modified gravity, entropic gravity, string theory, and holographic duality have emerged. In essence, various theories, from realist or purely mathematical instrumentalist perspectives, have attempted to fuse the geometry of relativity with the quantum mechanisms of QFT to construct a unified field. In the language of QFT, this naturally leads to the hypothesis of a fundamental quantum field from which all microscopic particles are excitations.

3. The Problem: The geometric degrees of freedom are incompatible with the gauge degrees of freedom. GR's geometric degrees of freedom are based on diffeomorphism invariance, whereas the Standard Model of QFT, which explains electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions (QCD) and the Higgs mechanism, relies on degrees of freedom like spin. The gauge group's degrees of freedom inevitably disrupt the differential topological homeomorphism of GR at the Planck scale. This contradiction represents the most significant ontological obstacle to a unified field theory. Previous research has attempted to either abandon GR's diffeomorphism invariance, introducing dynamic reconnection of geometric degrees of freedom (like topology), or, as in string theory, bypass ontological realism altogether, seeking solutions directly from mathematical constructions.

4. Achieving compatibility between geometric degrees of freedom and gauge-symmetric dynamical degrees of freedom is the primary characteristic and goal of this model. This model starts from a commitment to realism. It not only preserves GR's diffeomorphism invariance but further introduces global topological invariance to ensure global energy conservation. It proposes a quantized elastic two-layer base space model.

The foundational architecture of this model is as follows: Its base layer is a topologically homeomorphic and invariant spatial network composed of sub-Planckian elastic spatial components. On this network, structurally stable "Space Elementary Quanta" (SEQ) and a nodal, quantized spatial network are constructed from the same sub-Planckian components, forming a secondary layer. These SEQs are connected or filled by the underlying sub-Planckian elastic components. This results in a two-layer fiber bundle base space structure, with the sub-Planckian components as the fundamental substrate (base) and the SEQs forming the secondary layer (fibers/bundle).

On this base space, because the SEQs themselves are composed of sub-Planckian components, the "spin" of an SEQ is essentially a topologically protected spin excitation conduction wave on the underlying sub-Planckian topological network. This allows for the decoupling of spin (gauge) and geometry (elasticity) under low-energy conditions without altering the fundamental spatial topology. Matter is fundamentally a compressed excitation state of space, and the motion of matter is essentially a topologically protected, invariant excitation wave propagating on space. Motion at each level is fundamentally a wave on the substrate of the level below, thereby realizing dynamics without breaking the topological homeomorphic structure. Based on this, it becomes straightforward to define the two fundamental connections: the gauge group of QFT and the metric tensor of GR. This enables the model to simultaneously accommodate the mathematical frameworks and phenomenological interpretations of both QFT and GR.

5. On this quantized elastic two-layer chiral spatial network model, the energy carried by an SEQ can represent the quantum spin-resonance energy of space. Furthermore, the elastic potential energy of space can be decomposed and assigned to the SEQs in relevant regions. That is, the entire spatial energy distribution can be represented solely by the energy carried by the SEQs. Once the energy distribution of the entire space is constructed using the energy of the SEQs, each step in the dynamic energy distribution of this quantized elastic space corresponds to a step of spatial transformation. The Second Law of Thermodynamics manifests as the process of energy distribution homogenization. On this basis, multiplicative entropy can be used to define the entropy value of each spatial transformation, which can then be mapped onto a time set. This clearly defines cosmic time and embeds the thermodynamic arrow of time from the Second Law into the models of GR and QFT. A key postulate of this model is that the entire space is topologically homeomorphic and invariant; all motion and change amount to a dynamic redistribution of energy across this immutable network.

6. The Geometric Image of QCD and the Higgs Mechanism: The model posits that the compressive energy of mass primarily originates from the highly compressed initial state of the universe. QCD represents the dynamic, highly compressed process localized within atomic nuclei. The symmetry of the SU(3) group corresponds precisely to the dynamic maintenance of quasi-spherical symmetry in this compressed state; its complex number representation inherently incorporates compression-stretching phase modulation. The Higgs mechanism corresponds to the coupling, under high-energy conditions in this model, between the spatial spinor (associated with the Kerr metric) and the quantum twistor (associated with the Einstein-Cartan Theory, ECT, and represented in the model by the fixed-chirality spin of the SEQ). This coupling generates a geometric image akin to a "screw-cap tightening" mechanism—a spontaneous symmetry-breaking energy-locking mechanism.

From the above, this model provides a compatibility scheme between Wheeler's "mass as geometry" and the dynamic evolutionary degrees of freedom of the gauge symmetry in the Standard Model of QFT.

The model also provides a time theory based on the time-multiplicative entropy mapping. As this article primarily discusses gravitational theory, this aspect will not be elaborated here.

Furthermore, this two-layer, topologically invariant chiral space model also provides explanations for phenomena restored from Newtonian gravitational theory, such as the inverse-square law of gravitational force, why gravity cannot be shielded, and the disparity in strength between gravitational and QCD interactions.
